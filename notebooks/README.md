This directory currently contains the source code (jupyter notebook) which on which the PAMM-paper is mainly based.
It will be cleaned up in the near future.

The easiest way to view the notebook is via <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TUD-RST/MPCKC/blob/master/notebooks/qs_7-links-paper-figures.ipynb>. Note, however, that the animations are only available when running the notebook locally or on a server.
